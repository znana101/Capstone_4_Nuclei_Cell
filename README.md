# Capstone_4_Nuclei_Cell
This project provides a deep learning model for automated cell nuclei segmentation, a vital step in accelerating research across various diseases, including cancer, Alzheimer's, diabetes, and cardiovascular disorders. By accurately identifying cell nuclei in microscopic images, this model enables researchers to analyze cellular DNA and assess cellular responses to different treatments. The model leverages semantic segmentation to streamline drug testing and potentially reduce the time for new therapies to reach patients. This tool has the potential to significantly enhance the speed and efficiency of biomedical research and drug discovery processes.
